# Quantifying-Promoter-Element-Activation-in-Marchantia-polymorpha-gemma
This project was created to act on an an image library containing images of nuclear localised fluorescent proteins (proMpARF3:Venus and
proMpYuC2:mTurquoise) and chlorophyll autofluorescence images for 153 gemma. The aim was to generate a tool for quantitatively describing fluorescently labelled nuclei distributions in M. polymorpha gemmae regardless of shape variations.
